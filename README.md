Explore Progressive Web Apps functionalities without resorting to creating native apps

Please stop making native apps that won't do anything more than showing a
Web page or still pictures. We users are just sick of it already! And it takes up
prime real estate on our phone's memory too, which makes the beautiful piece of
code you put in hours to develop into a good candidate for the scrap heap.

Instead, make a PWA and reap the benefits of an ever-evolving field of Web development
without the hassle of managing multiple codebases.

This repository was built to show you how you can do it and what features can be embedded
on a hosted PWA. You'll be amazed that much of what you thought that could only be done
within native applications can now be easily integrated to a Web-based solution.
